# Tic-Tac-Toe
  
  Software Details:
    Python 3.6
    Anaconda Navigator
      Spyder IDE
  
  This is my first project on Python. I made this old game called "Tic-Tac-Toe ('X' and '0')" using Python.
  Now there are two files with the extension ".py". First one contains the code for Single Player version i.e. Human versus Computer. And second one contains code for Two Player version i.e. Human versus Human.
  Since, I didn't use any OS Automation Module(s). Hence it won't make any smart moves in Single Player version.
